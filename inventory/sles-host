# inventory can be expressed in an ini format
# careful with extensions to files when using an inventory directory, they can lead to the file being excluded and thus missing inventory. For example, `.ini` files in an inventory directory
  # See INVENTORY_IGNORE_EXTS for default ignored extensions
  # ansible-config --list # then look for INVENTORY_IGNORE_EXTS
